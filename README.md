# Expense Tracker (Calculadora de Gastos)

A simple web application to keep track of your expenses, it is developed with react no backend only storing in localStorage, the idea is for it to work like a mobile app using the "Add to homescreen" feature. The motivation for developing this is the excessive feature bloat of most of this kind of apps, I included only what is helpful and useful to me and nothing else. You can import expenses, copy expenses and clean all of it when your done (end of the month).
